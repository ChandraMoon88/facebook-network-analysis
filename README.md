# Facebook Network Analysis

## Overview
This project performs network analysis on Facebook data using the provided Jupyter Notebook. It explores graph-based insights, such as community detection, centrality measures, and visualization of social connections.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on a Facebook dataset, which contains nodes (users) and edges (connections between users). The data is processed and analyzed using Python libraries like NetworkX, Matplotlib, and Pandas.

## Features
- **Graph Construction**: Builds a social network graph from the dataset.
- **Degree & Centrality Analysis**: Computes degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality.
- **Community Detection**: Identifies clusters using modularity-based methods.
- **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib and NetworkX for network visualization.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib pandas
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook facebook-network-analysis.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells step by step to analyze the Facebook network.

## Results
- **Key Influencers**: Identifies users with the highest centrality.
- **Community Structure**: Detects groups within the network.
- **Graph Visualization**: Provides visual insights into the network structure.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute by improving the analysis, adding new features, or optimizing the visualization techniques.
